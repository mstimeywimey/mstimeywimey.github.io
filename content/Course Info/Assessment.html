                                	<p>Assessment of assignments will involve three perspectives:</p>

                                        	<p>Formal and informal feedback mechanisms used by instructors during the course to inform candidates about their progress will include:</p>

Candidates who are unsuccessful with specific assignments will be provided with opportunities to resubmit the assignment after it has been revised based upon the instructor feedback.</p>

Where there is cause to consider not recommending a participant, this will be communicated to the candidates well in advance with steps taken to provide support. ETFO believes very strongly that there should be no surprises regarding academic achievement &ndash; candidates who are at risk of being unsuccessful in the course will be informed of this as soon as concerns are evident and supports will be put in place to assist them.</p>
